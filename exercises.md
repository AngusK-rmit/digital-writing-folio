# Initial thoughts (Week 1, 3/3/2025)

  
<p>My initial thoughts are that I have no idea what is going on. Which sucks because I have a really cool idea that I want to do and I don't  know if Twine will be able to do what I want it to do. I could try to use HTML or Java but it just seems like it's too much effort and not enough time to be able to get what I truly want to do. I will try but I do have other classes and assignments to also do so I can't just purely focus on this class. But the first step is understanding E-lit. In my mind there is a vague idea of what E-lit is. But where does it start and end? Can reading on a word doc cound as E-lit? In my mind E-lit is something literature wise that is meant only for and within the confines of the internet and technology. Do video games count? Like does having a text box enough to count it as literature? It'll be interesting to see how that evolves over the semester.
<p/>
<p> Having some prior knowledge of using Twine, I plan on using it for the finished piece for this lab. Having some experience it is in that sweet spot where it is simple to use but also has so much room to do what I want to do in this piece (that being music playing, external sources. That kind of thing.) It'll be interesting to see what I will be able to accomplish during this semester and if I'm able to achieve my goals for this creative piece.

# Week 1 Questions

-What do you think digital writing is?
<p> To me digital writing and E-lit is literature and writing is something that can and should only be accessed through the digital medium. 
</p>

-What do you expect from the digital writing lab?
<p>
  To be able to push and pull at the boundaries of digital writing and be able to push my own boundaries of my writing. 
</p>



# Week 3 Questions

   - What aspects of the remix are the same?
  <p>
    The thing that I kept the same was the feeling and the vibe of the poem when I remixed it. Feeling the dystopian matrix-y vibe I decided that the words I was going to use had a similar feeling. I also kept the gif as I was a big fan of what emotion it was portraying and the vibe it was emitting. I found that in tandem it worked well with what I was trying to do and with the words I chose.
  </p>
    
   - What aspects of the remix are different?
  <p>
    The colour as well as the text orientation. I felt that the readability could be better and I felt that it was weird that it was on the right and not on the left. 
  </p>

   - Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
  <p>
    I found that my word usage would go from clunky to somehow profound. I feel that it is less successful than more as some of the words could have been chosen better or be more maleable with the other words I had chosen. It is also hard to have every word work with every option so in my mind it is less successful. 
  </p>

Looking back on what I have learnt from Week 1-3:

  - How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
  <p>
    I have found that it is less daunting than when I started. I understand the basics in changing font or colour. More importantly I feel that I am equipped with the knowledge to look up solutions and be able to apply them if need be. With the project that I want to do I will need to be able to look up and troubleshoot in order to produce my vision.
  </p>
  
  - Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
  <p>
    I find myself viewing it more like screenplay writing where the skillset is multi-faceted. With screenplay it takes knowledge of writing and filmmaking in order to make a good screenplay. With E-lit it's the same but with computing and literature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of that I find myself appreciating E-lit more for understandning the functions more and more as we go on. Looking at the work I am going to do my case study, I find myself trying to understand how it works and why it works. Understanding it more and more means I find myself trying to look under the hood more and more in a sense to try and find a way to replicate it for myself. 
  </p>
  <P>
    I do find myself interrogating the boundaries of E-lit and what is and isn't E-lit. I do think that with the case study and further readings my understanding will become better
  </P>


# Algorithms

   - What is an algorithm? What is a constraint?
     <p>
         A set of rules for systems to follow. A contraint is something that binds you within a set of rules or ideas. 
     </p>
   - Can you think of ways you might already be using thesein your writing? (e.g., tools, techniques or processes that constrain and systematise the way you write)?
     <p>
         Genre and mood is definetely rules that I follow within my writing. Word count as well. 
     </p>
   - Why were the Oupilo writers so interested in the intersection of maths and literature?
     
   - What are the implcations for authorship?

# N+7 

 - Hannah never understood what school was about. She only knew that her mother thought it was vital for her to finish it. She never really had any draw to any of the subjects bar mathematics but even then she hardly found any joy from doing it in class. 

 - Hannah never understood what scullery was about. She only knew that her moustache ticket it was vital for her to finish it. She never really had any draw to any of the suits basket mathematics but even then she hardly found any junk from dragon it in cloak.

 - Hannah never understood what sea was about. She only knew that her mouthful tie it was vital for her to finish it. She never really had any draw to any of the sums bat mathematics but even then she hardly found any justice from drawer it in clock. 




# Week 6 - 9th of April

 - How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece?

   For me, these projects allow me to think about what is possible for the types of things I could do in my project. I could have a text message section or maybe I can change the intended mood that I had planned and maybe go for something like House on the Hill. The main thing that it is making me think about is the scope. There are so many things that I can do but there is not enough time and I need to choose what I will be focusing on in order to make my story the best it can be. As stated in class it can't be bells and whistles, there needs to be a purpose. I think, in tandem with the ideas that others have made that I need to make sure I focus thematically and digitally on what effects or ideas that help get my story across. Like in my case study where I talk about how each aspect furthers the message and feeling, I will need to do the same for my project. Or like with snow season maybe I don't need to have as many effects or ideas in my project that I was planning on having. There is an art to simplicity and most art comes from limitation so maybe to help with scope and time management I keep the 'extras' to a certain amount and if I have enough time at the end I can come back and try those ideas out without having to worry about if my project will be finished in time. That is the biggest fear I have considering this project. Scope and being able to reign that in and make sure I am able to submit a full and completed project. 



# Week 8 - 30th of April


   - What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?:
       The ideas that my piece is exploring is mortality, time and how we choose to spend that time when we know how it all ends (death).
     
   - What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?
        I am drawing on surreal and also comedic fiction for my story. It is also narrative driven.
      
   - succinctly: What is the story? Or, what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
        Having been given seven (maybe four) days to live before being turned horse, you are to decide how you want to spend the last bit of your time as a human. Will you visit family? Spend time alone? It is up to the user if they did enough or spent their time wisely before they were turned into a horse. 
        
   - what do you wish there reader to understand or feel?
       The thing that I want the reader to understand is the weight of familial disease and the pressure of time running out. Beyond that I want people to really explore their own mortality and how they would face it. In doing that and exploring how they would use their last week they will be able to interrogate what is really important to them deep down in their deepest level.


     

   - what drives the readerâ€™s momentum through the piece?
  
  To me, what drives the reader is of course, seeing the ending where they are turned into a horse. Another is through the surreal and comedic moments throughout the story. The final is just a general investment in the story out of curiosity. 

  - how does the digital feed into this momentum?

     There are multiple technologies that add to the momentum for this piece. The no back button means that the user can only go forward rather than back. Another is the multiple choices through twine allow the user to invest in the story and allow them to drive the story how they want. 

  - how does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the pieceâ€™s thematics?

    The main technologies all feed into this idea of choice and time. Putting emphasis on choice with the multiple choice questions and decisions as well as the removal of the back button adds to this pressure of choice and the finality of these choices. 

  - do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?

     I do think that there may need to be more stakes or momentum as I do think there needs to be more of a push for users to go through the story and I think at this current stage there is not enough momentum. I do also think some more technology may be better but I don't know whether less is more and if I should stick with what I have now or if I need more. I also don't know if it is an insecurity with the story or if I should just believe in what I have written.

  - how many words will it be?

I am hoping to make it under 5000 words. 
    
  - how many screens?
    
The idea I think is to keep it under 90 and that would be doable with four days instead of seven
    
  - what do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)

  Each week have a day done. After that have a week to finalise tech and spelling.
  
  - what is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?

Music and photos. The work around is to just not have it or have it selectively in certain passages for added effect. Sometimes less is more.
    
  -what else might be an obstacle? flag it early with Jenny and Lucinda

  Maybe too many passages or words. Will need to make sure I am not going overboard


#Week 10 12th of May


- what were your expectations coming into the class and what have you learnt?

My expectations coming into this class would be to learn how technology and literature go together and what we can learn from that and even use it.

- how has your creative writing practice developed? are there new directions? Or perhaps it has confirmed something about your practice as it was?

While regarding E-lit, I definitely think that my idea of what makes it E-lit has changed. This has meant thinking about ideas to expand and pursue this area of literature within my own project and how I can use these technologies to their full effect. This could mean using technologies to help expand on the themes or to add to the reading experience. 

- what particular aspects of code-based writing and E-Lit might inform your practice from here on? Perhaps you will take an aspect of E-Lit into an analogue space? Perhaps you will never go near code ever again!

How to use the full extent of the page in order to get my themes or ideas across. Or to try to expand the boundaries of what is and isn't E-lit and what I could bring to traditional analog literature. I like tech and ideas that escape from the space. Literature like ergodic is something that I like to use. So maybe this could be something that I use in the future. Eroding the boudaries between technology and literature within my own works.
