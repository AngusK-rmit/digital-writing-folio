# Initial thoughts (Week 1, 3/3/2025)

  
<p>My initial thoughts are that I have no idea what is going on. Which sucks because I have a really cool idea that I want to do and I don't  know if Twine will be able to do what I want it to do. I could try to use HTML or Java but it just seems like it's too much effort and not enough time to be able to get what I truly want to do. I will try but I do have other classes and assignments to also do so I can't just purely focus on this class.
