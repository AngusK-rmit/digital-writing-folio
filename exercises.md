# Initial thoughts (Week 1, 3/3/2025)

  
<p>My initial thoughts are that I have no idea what is going on. Which sucks because I have a really cool idea that I want to do and I don't  know if Twine will be able to do what I want it to do. I could try to use HTML or Java but it just seems like it's too much effort and not enough time to be able to get what I truly want to do. I will try but I do have other classes and assignments to also do so I can't just purely focus on this class. But the first step is understanding E-lit. In my mind there is a vague idea of what E-lit is. But where does it start and end? Can reading on a word doc cound as E-lit? In my mind E-lit is something literature wise that is meant only for and within the confines of the internet and technology. It'll be interesting to see how that evolves over the semester.
<p/>
<p> Having some prior knowledge of using Twine, I plan on using it for the finished piece for this lab. Having some experience it is in that sweet spot where it is simple to use but also has so much room to do what I want to do in this piece (that being music playing, external sources. That kind of thing.) It'll be interesting to see what I will be able to accomplish during this semester and if I'm able to achieve my goals for this creative piece.
