# Interaction with Electronic Literature Collection

<p>Looking at the collection I found a game called Kentucky Route Zero. Having played it a little before starting this class I was confused seeing in this collection. What makes this game different from the others? Is this different from 'other' walking sims? The definintion of E-lit seems to be getting more muddled and messy. I liken it to paint melting into each other on the canvas. But I do love the game and I could use it as inspiration for my own project.

Volume 1- The Possession of Christian Shaw is an interesting piece. It blurs the line of flawed perspective that I think only E-lit could. In normal, traditional media. The flawed perspective of someone mentally ill is usually metaphorical. However, here we are able to see this perspective as if we were Christian Shaw. Unabashed and true it gives us a perspective that is rare and only afforded by a visual medium like E-lit. I enjoyed Possession of Christian Shaw. I thought its use of perspective was really powerful and meaningful. 

Volume 2- Up against the screen is a meta piece. It’s clear that the piece is about the way that we interact with technology and how that has affected our brains. The way that the man reads out the piece in my eyes counts as the literature part of the E-lit. To me this is what E-lit is. Something that could not exist on the spectrum of print media. The piece is about technology with technology. 

The piece was overwhelming in a sense that I was trying to understand how it was E-lit to begin with. Then, as the man started talking I got the idea and it made it so much clearer as to what it was about. 

Volume 3- In volume three I found Dwarf Fortress. A game. But I know the story of Dwarf Fortress. Written all in code and the art made from ASCII it’s clear to me why this was included as E-lit. The entire foundation and everything was written, making it literature. But I am still confused as to what the difference is between video games and E-lit.  

While I want to like it, it’s just not something I have the energy nor the time to understand enough to enjoy. But I love the energy and love that was put into this project. 

Volume 4 - Looking at the collection I found a game called Kentucky Route Zero. Having played it a little before starting this class I was confused seeing in this collection. What makes this game different from the others? Is this different from 'other' walking sims? The definition of E-lit seems to be getting more muddled and messy. I liken it to paint melting into each other on the canvas. But I do love the game and I could use it as inspiration for my own project.



# Defining Electronic Literature


- What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

    I read the Taroko Gorge Poem. To me, the elements are text generation that seems to be random but somehow tell a coherent story that is up to the individual to interpret. The green background also seems to give off an 'electronic' vibe. 
  
- How are those elements meaningful?

    I think the reason for why it is meaningful is because I know that it is random. The sentences are clumped together by pure chance but somehow I always seem to read into what it is trying to say. I think it plays into the human mind and the way that it tries to find meaning in things that may or may not be there. 
  
- How are the works read differently from print literature?

    It's not possible to read scrolling text within print literature. The background colour as well as the text gives it a different read compared to what it would read as a print text. Beyond that, it's clear that it's the randomness of the text wouldn't come off as 'prophetic' or meaningful if it was clear someone had just randonly pasted some lines onto a page and then printed it off. It is the autheniticity of the randomness that makes it different from print literature. 
  
- How is electronic literature different from print literature?

    To me, for it to be E-lit, it needs to exist only online or electornically to be E-lit. If it could exist on print and have the same message get across then to me, it shouldn't be considered E-lit. 
    
- What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

    I think using the capabilities of the internet (things like hypertext, chat and even websites) as well as the comuputer (things like games or procedural generation) to be what we shoudl consider as the qualities of E-lit when dissecting what it is and what should be included. The point is that it is meant to exist in this digital space so anything that uses the capabilities of that space are what is important. Even though text is the same between print and E-lit, I still think that as long as it can't exist the same way as print media then it should count as E-lit. Though the difference between video games and E-lit still elude me.


# “Decolonize” E-Literature? On Weeding the E-lit Garden

I found this piece to be really interesting in what it had to say. It's interesting because every other type of art form I have encountered has either been around for hundreds of years or just enough time that there is now a solid scholary field around it. It really brings into question what do we want 'E-lit' to be like? Feel like? Look like? 

It's interesting to me because I am someone that wasn't able to see the early days of the internet. I didn't see MySpace or the personal blogs that littered the internet. Like the generations of E-lit, I would consider myself growing up in the second gen phase. There were lots of rough edges to the internet. Nothing was quite as unified or corporotised as it is now. But it didn't have that loose feel as the 90's regarding the internet. I bring this up because the reading brings up a good point of trying to argue whether E-lit _needs_ a scholary space. Why can't it just be an artform that allows anyone regardless of anything to be able to access and contribute? Like the early days of the internet, it was a freeform place of expression, unlike today where there is a smoothed over pressence to everything. 

I do think scholary circles are important to any artform. The need to delve deeper into works and how they operate is the sign of a healthy artform. In a sense, it is a machine that feeds itself. Rather than being a small niche, scholary investigation allows the art to grow. But it does raise a good point about the expectations and POV's that can come and persuade what is a really non-identity artform. 

Even beyond that it raises a good point about the issues that can arise out of the definitions of what is and isn't E-lit. Who gets to decide? Why do they get to decide? Why does it matter? Are all valid questions and definitions allow things like colonialism to take its hold in the artform. 

This piece brought to my attention something that I didn't think about. There are lots of implications as to how this could go down in the future and I am curious how this will effect E-lit in the future. 


# Electronic Literature: What is it?

Its hard to read into this piece especially right after reading the piece before this. I will say however, that the way that they describe what is and isn't E-lit. I do want to acknowledge that the decolonising of E-lit does bring into question who it is that is defining what is and ins't E-lit.

I still think that it is important to at least try to do define and understand the boundaries of what could be considered E-lit. 

I did use this source for my case study as I think that the way that it talks about the differences between video games and E-lit to be an important discussion especially because I am confused as to where the line is drawn. 

This piece also highlights the progression that E-lit has made between the first generation pieces and the second and now third. Overall, this piece is a very important piece for understanding what is E-lit and what it entails as well as the progression it has made over the decades. Something trhat I can bring into my practice as well as knowledge. 

# No senses of an ending : hypertext aesthetic
This text was a hard one to get through. While I don't think I understand all of it, I feel that I got the gist of what it was trying to say. 

The author delves into the place that hypertext has in the literary space, bringing up postmodernist and modern rhetoric, the author argues that hypertext as an entire field has a future but needs more exploration in order to understand and grow the field. But the author delves into the specifics and the stories that surround hypertext. The author brings up Ergodic literature which is something that I am fondly aware of. Having read House of Leaves and A Pale Fire, the medium is not new to me. 

The entire point of the paper is to understand the perspective, restraints and the construction of hypertext. When reading I understood why the author brought up Ergodic literature. Both are in essence, a ‘meta’ form of literature. Both forms are aware of the user and understand that it itself is to be read (if that makes sense) and explored. Ergodic literature requires ‘extra’ effort to read and understand the story, this could be linked to the ‘effort’ users must use to click links, images and the like in order to understand the story. 

Another thing that the source talks about which I found interesting is how hypertext allows meaning to be created in how the user interacted and read the story in how they chose to navigate the story. This reminds me of the Electronic collection Vol 2. Up Against the Screen. I can just imagine how if it were in a particular place or if it was linked in a particular area of a story how it could really mean something different. I only mention it because I had a similar experience going from the collection menu to the artpiece. Which in itself could be considered a story (which I do). 

I think it is really cool how this author is able to dissect the hypertext medium and I think I have learnt a lot from what it was trying to say.
